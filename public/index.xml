&lt;h4 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome! I am a writer and all-around logical thinker who worked my way into an interesting and challenging technology career. I&amp;rsquo;ve worn several hats, as you can see below; but no matter the role, I try to bring problem-solving and improved documentation to the table. I enjoy helping people make software, and software development proceseses, work better for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;career&#34;&gt;Career&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;quality assurance analyst&lt;/strong&gt; (2013 - present), I write test plans and test cases, and do the testing on, all enhancements to our software products. We have a small department with no dedicated technical writer, so I volunteer to author any documents I am able to. I write guides to using new features, attempting to bridge the gap between product delivery and product implementation and usage. I also help developers refine the instructional and error text that appears in our user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;user acceptance tester&lt;/strong&gt; (2011 - 2013), I scrutinized documents that were generated by our automated system to ensure that they were properly formatted as well as technically accurate. I pointed out errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and recommended changes to business-recommended language where I felt improvement was needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first &lt;strong&gt;multi-faceted technical role&lt;/strong&gt; (2008 - 2011), I translated product owners&amp;rsquo; ideas into functional specifications and narrative product descriptions. I wrote conference abstracts and RFP responses to help promote our services. I developed test cases and testing guidelines to improve internal quality assurance processes. I also wrote training materials for our customers.
​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;personal&#34;&gt;Personal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a previous life as a city planner (2007 - 2008), I wrote staff reports that analyzed development proposals for adherence to zoning and environmental regulations.
​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://cascadewallflower.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;personal blog&lt;/a&gt; that is updated once in a while. In my free time I love to ride my bike, play Scrabble, sing karaoke, eat pie, and snuggle with my cats.&lt;/p&gt;
